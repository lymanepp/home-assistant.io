The `eight_sleep` integration allows Home Assistant to fetch data from your [Eight Sleep](https://eightsleep.com/) smart cover or mattress.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor - lets observe the presence state of a [Eight Sleep](https://eightsleep.com/) cover/mattress through Home Assistant.
- Sensor - This includes bed state, sleep fitness scores, and results of the current and previous sleep sessions.

## Notice

This integration relies on an undocumented API utilized by the Eight Sleep mobile app to communicate with the Eight Sleep servers. It is not supported by Eight Sleep and may malfunction if changes are made to either the mobile app operation or the API format.
