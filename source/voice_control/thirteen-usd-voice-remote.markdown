## Installing the software onto the ATOM Echo

1. Make sure this page is opened in a Chromium-based browser on a desktop. It does not work on a tablet or phone.
   * Select the **Connect** button below. If your browser does not support web serial, there is no button but a text.

      <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/esp-web-tools@9/dist/web/install-button.js?module"></script>
      <esp-web-install-button manifest="https://firmware.esphome.io/voice-assistant/m5stack-atom-echo/manifest.json"></esp-web-install-button>
   * **For advanced users**: The configuration file is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/m5stack-atom-echo.yaml).

1. Connect the ATOM Echo to your computer.
   * In the popup window, view the available ports.
   * Plug the USB-C cable into the ATOM Echo and connect it to your computer.
   * In the pop-up window, there should now appear a new entry. Select this USB serial port and select **Connect**.
     * Depending on your computer, the entry might look different.
